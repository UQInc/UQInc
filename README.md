# UQInc
An idle clicker game where you can live your dream of building the University of Queensland. Brought to you in Rust.

# How to Run
UQInc requires rust and cargo in order to run. 
To start, in the terminal run:
    cargo run

From there the game will open and you can begin clicking and buying upgrades to play.
Upon completion the buildings menu on the right hand side will be empty and the map will be complete.
Each building purchase will award 1 perk point which can be spent in the perks menu to increase the 
number of students per click and the amount of money you get per student.
